Choosing Mutation and Crossover Ratios for
Genetic Algorithmsâ€”A Review with a New
Dynamic Approach

- Parameter tuning, not any kind of dynamic adaptive procedure to find cross_prob
    and mut_prob
- High cross prob, low mut prob (otherwise random search)

------

- Tournament selection for tsppar_th
- tried classes (still in proj folder?) but too complex design for parallel programming
